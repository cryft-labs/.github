# Cryft Labs

**Cryft Labs** is building the **Cryft Network** — a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain ecosystem designed for secure, decentralized, and privacy-preserving applications.

We are developing infrastructure for high-performance blockchain networks, including custom nodes, tokens, wallets, trusted execution environments (TEEs), and innovative on-chain redeemable systems.

Our flagship innovation includes an **on-chain managed redeemable gift code system** — enabling secure, transparent redemption of digital assets (e.g., NFTs, tokens, or experiences) via physical/digital cards, receipts, stickers, or other carriers. This system uses:
- **Public smart contracts** for transparent status management (active/frozen, content assignment)
- **Private smart contracts** for secure, encrypted storage and verification of codes
- Integration with blockchain wallets, tokens, and external APIs for delivery

This architecture addresses limitations of traditional centralized gift systems: hacking risks, lack of transparency, and inflexibility.
